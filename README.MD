## Usage

Creating toasts is super simple, first you create a new instnce of the AvocadoToast class. 

```javascript
    var notifications = new AvocadoToast();
```

then create a new toast using the creat(options) method.

```javascript
    notifications.create({text: "I ‚ù§Ô∏è avocado toast!"})
```

### Options

When creating a new toast notification you have a couple options to pass in.  More options will be coming in future updates!

- text {string} : The text that will appear within the toast. 
- delay {int} : How long the toast will last before it disappears.
